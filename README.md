### Assignment 1 - The Diet Problem Revisited
This repository contains the implementation of a linear programming (LP) model to solve a diet optimization problem, designed for MSDS 460: Decision Analytics. The project aims to minimize weekly food costs while satisfying U.S. FDA nutritional requirements using a selection of five food items.

### Includes

- Image Files of food nutrition labels

### assignment1_paper.pdf
Discusses the method and result of the formulated diet optimization problem and the revised version with additional constraints and use of LLM models on optimization problems.

### assignment1.py
Includes Python code of the linear programming formulation with decision variables, objective function, and constraints. It also includes the output of the problem which shows the optimal solution found through PuLP.

### Image Files of food nutrition labels
Includes images of nutrition facts of the five selected food choice for the problem: ribeye steak, chicken and apple sausage, kimbap, Greek yogurt, and tofu.
